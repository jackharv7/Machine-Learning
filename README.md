# Results

Both Logistic Regression and SVM models were use to train the exoplanet data. The results find that the SVM model with a linear kernel yields and testing accuracy of 87% while the Logistic Regression model's accuracy was 86%. In conclusion, the SVM model is more accurate than the Logistic Regression model.
